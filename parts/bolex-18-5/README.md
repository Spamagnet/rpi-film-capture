# Bolex 18-5 Support

These parts are from [Rob Scott's Bolex 18-5 build](http://rob.scottclan.cc/2017/07/telecine-project-part-1/).

# Camera bracket
The Bolex 18-5 has an adjustable lamp bracket. The `arducam-bracket.scad` part is designed to attach to the lamp bracket and hold an Arducam. See [part 2 of the build](http://rob.scottclan.cc/2017/07/telecine-project-part-2-camera-and-light/).

# Light source holder
The `led-holder.scad` part is a cylindrical holder for the LED and diffuser that fits inside the projector lens barrel. See [part 2 of the build](http://rob.scottclan.cc/2017/07/telecine-project-part-2-camera-and-light/).

# Pulley
The `pulley.scad` part is a pulley which attaches to the NEMA 17 stepper motor and then drives the projector mechanism via a belt/O-ring. See [part 3 of the build](http://rob.scottclan.cc/2017/07/telecine-project-part-3-shutter-and-motor/).
