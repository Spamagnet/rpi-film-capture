# Bolex 18-5

These parts are from [Rob Scott's Bolex 18-5 build](http://rob.scottclan.cc/2017/07/telecine-project-part-1/). The [Bolex 18-5](http://www.bolexcollector.com/projectors/185.html) is a standard 8mm silent projector manufactured from 1961 through 1963. An upgraded model with auto-threading, the [Bolex 18-5 Auto](http://www.bolexcollector.com/projectors/185auto.html), was manufactured from 1963 through 1966.

It is a well-built projector and lends itself well to this project.

## Camera bracket

### Mark 1
The Bolex 18-5 has an adjustable lamp bracket. The `arducam-bracket-mark-1.scad` part is designed to attach to the lamp bracket and hold an Arducam. See [part 2 of the build](http://rob.scottclan.cc/2017/07/telecine-project-part-2-camera-and-light/).

### Mark 2
The `arducam-bracket-mark-2.scad` part is designed to be bolted directly to the metal plate. It also has a support for a [9-22mm CCTV zoom lens](http://a.co/6X0dezo), in order to prevent the fairly large lens from wobbling or vibrating.

## Light source holder
The `led-holder.scad` part is a cylindrical holder for the LED and diffuser that fits inside the projector lens barrel. See [part 2 of the build](http://rob.scottclan.cc/2017/07/telecine-project-part-2-camera-and-light/).

## Pulley
The `pulley.scad` part is a pulley which attaches to the NEMA 17 stepper motor and then drives the projector mechanism via a belt/O-ring. See [part 3 of the build](http://rob.scottclan.cc/2017/07/telecine-project-part-3-shutter-and-motor/).
